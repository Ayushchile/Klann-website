<ul>
    <p>In the current landscape, social media is not social anymore, it's more like media. Where the focus is shifting away from engaging social interactions and towards passive content consumption. The one size fits all approach treats every relationship/connection as the same. The feed is controlled by algorithms & advertisements rather than driven by
relationship. This is creating a gap, as people still have a basic human need to freely connect with their friends, family and colleagues. <br>
Klann is a platform where you can connect with people who matter to you, with privacy!<p>

    <p> <strong>KLANN: </strong> </p>

<ul>
    <li>Go back to basics of networking -> Connect with People who matter toYou!</li>
    <li>Ability to segregate the networks based on relationships, because every relationship/connection has a value & story</li>
    <li>Ensure privacy of personal data & content to create a safe and positive
        space for User to be authentic</li>
    <li>Communities based on mutual interests to explore the things they love</li>
    <li>Feed: Not controlled by algorithms but driven by relationships</li>
